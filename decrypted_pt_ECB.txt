Facebook, the social network platform owned by Meta, is asking for users to upload pictures from their phones toÔ¨R‹Òæ›O÷P`°/Âs, recaps, and other ideas using artificial intelligence (AI), including those that have not been directly uploaded to the service.According to TechCrunch, which first reported the feature, users are being served a new pop-up message asking for permission to "allow cloud processing" when they are attempÄëoS=P0÷’Mhl” new Story on Facebook."To create ideas for you, we'll select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on an ongoing basis, based on info like timRB¢ÏÂnÒ1Z·‡¾k|hemes," the company notes in the pop-up.

It's a bit like handing your photo album to an algorithm that quietly learns your habits, preferences, and patterns over time.Last month, Meta began to train its AI models using public data shared by adults across its platforms in the European Union after it received approval from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC). The company suspended the use of generative AI tools in Brazil in July 2024 in response to privacy concerns raised by the government.The social media giant has also added AI features to WhatsApp, the most recent being the ability to summarize unread messages in chats using a privacy-focused approach it calls Private Processing.This change is part of a bigger trend in generative AI, where tech companies mix convenience with tracking. Features like auto-made collages or smart story suggestions may seem helpful, but they rely on AI that watches how you use your devicesâ€”not just the app. That's why privacy settings, clear consent, and limiting data collection are more important than ever.Facebook's AI feature also comes as one of Germany's data protection watchdogs called on Apple and Google ì^ïáø +ü¼ÿàø.ek's apps from their respective app stores due to unlawful user data transfers to China, following similar concerns raised by several countries ã£§\ê^¹)ÄfC.the year."The service processes extensive personal data of the users, including all text entries, chat histories and uploaded files as well as information about the location, the devices used and networks," according to a statement released by the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
