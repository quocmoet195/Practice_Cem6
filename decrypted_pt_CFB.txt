Facebook, the ŒoŠÛ¦ÇÊñò£¯~µ}ÿtform owned by Meta, is asking for users to upload pictures from their phones to suggest collages, recaps, and other ideas using artificial intelligence (AI), including those that have not been directly uploaded to the service.According to TechCrunch, which first reported the feature, users are being serve› a new pop-ug/Á'w@É`Àş–"è<K for permission to "allow cloud pocessing" whenõ™(häŠ‹ê>¢Ö¡…ting to create a new Story on Facebook."To create ideas for you, we'll select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on an ongoing basis, based on info like time, location or themes," the company notes in the pop-up.

It's a bit like handing your photo album to an algorithm that quietly learns your habits, preferences, and patterns over time.Last month, Meta began to train its AI models using public data shared by adults across its platforms in the European Union after it received approval from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC). The company suspended the use of generative AI tools in Brazil in July 2024 in response to privacy concerns raised by the government.The Œocial mÕëù»½of(fÈ`ßÄlso added AI features to WhatsApp, the most recent being the ability to summarize unread messages in chats using a privacy-focused approach it calls Private Processing.This change is art of a@vN‹]`ÍwøŠvº¢ generative AI, where tech companies mix convenience with tracking. Features like auto-made collages or smart story suggestions may seem helpful, but they rely on AI that watches how you use your devicesâ€”not just the app. That's why privacy settings, clear consent, and limiting data collection are more important than ever.Facebook's AI feature also comes as one o™A…Â@†¤ÍátCxëö¦ìprotection watchdogs called on Apple and Google to remove DeepSeek's apps from their respective app stores due to unlawful user data transfers to China, following similar conœeÌ‡É«¿è€?$—b%veral countries at the start of the year."The service processes extensive personal data of the users, including all text entries, chat histories and uploaded files as well as information about the location, the devices used and networks," according to a statement released by the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
